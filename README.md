# Esi.S1.Average.Calculator

This is just a simple web app that i made with html, css and vanilla javascipt to calculate the first semester average note that this app only gives an aproximation to the average so it is not supposed to be that accurate but still it provides a decent aproximation of the average ,anyway if you encounter any bugs using it or have any feedback you can let me know at : f.slimani@esi-sba.dz

Enjoy !!
